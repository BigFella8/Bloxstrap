A script that attempts to recreate Bloxstrap, so you can use FFlags flawlessly.

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/new-qwertyui/Bloxstrap/main/loader.lua'))({
    HideMenu = false, -- change "false" to "true" if you want it to hide bloxstrap interface
    Previous = 0 -- change "0" to "1" if you want to use the previous bloxstrap upd
})
```
